  <h1>Thanks for coming! Let me show you around. </h1>
  <p> Conversations and collaborations are happening in the living room. </p>
  <p> You can check out what's cooking right now in the kitchen. </p>
  <p> Browse the gallery to see cool stuff that's finished (for now). </p>
  <p> Ideas are coming together in the study. </p>
  
  <p> And one last thing before you go. New ideas are always coming and going through the garage. </p>
  <p> Oh, and, as always, check out where the weathervane is pointed. </p>
