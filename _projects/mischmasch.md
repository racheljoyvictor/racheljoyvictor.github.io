<h1>MischMasch</h2>
<p>MischMasch is an interactive puzzle-game that was inspired by the works of Lewis Carroll, from his nonsense words to his eccentric characters to his love of geometry. While navigating a series of puzzles, players were treated to easter egg elements based on Carroll's life, like homages to his love of chessboards, nyctography, and Carroll's real name, and ultimately received a message straight from the man himself. </p>
